Genetic Algorithm for Polyphase Separation (GAPS) of fault-slip data
====================================================================

This is an extension of my previous work on [stress inversion](https://github.com/thehalfspace/stress-inversion). GAPS separates and inverts fault-slip data belonging to multiple stress states using a modified genetic algorithm approach.

Written in Julia 1.0.2

Work in progress. Hopefully will be completed by March 2019.
